A tile is an app's representation on the Start menu. Every app has a tile. When you create a new Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app project in Microsoft Visual Studio, it includes a default tile that displays your app's name and logo. Windows displays this tile when your app is first installed. After your app is installed, you can change your tile's content through notifications; for example, you can change the tile to communicate new information to the user, such as news headlines, or the subject of the most recent unread message.\\nTo find out more about Live Tiles, head to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/tiles-and-notifications-creating-tiles

This is a generic version of a MVVM pattern.  The Model-View-ViewModel pattern can be used on all XAML platforms. Its intent is to provide a clean separation of concerns between the user interface controls and their logic.

There are three core components in the MVVM pattern: the model, the view, and the view model. Each serves a distinct and separate role.

# Windows Template Studio New Page/New Feature commands

The commands "New Page" and "New Feature" allow you to generate a new item and integrate it with your project. 
The feature is composed of two steps: 

1. Generate the selected feature/page and its dependencies in a temporary folder and show you the result. 
2. Integrate the changes in your project or to just output the changes and integrate manually. 

See the following documentation to understand the different files shown on the changes summary page:

## Conflicting files
Files that were generated as part of the new feature/page but are already part of your project and are different.
This can happen for example if you already added a settings storage feature and then add it another time.  
The files will not be copied from the temporary generation folder to your project folder, but you have to review them, 
to see if everything is in the right place.

## Failed merges
To include the new feature/page WTS tried to modify files from your project, but could not do so.
There are two possible reasons for this:

* The file was not found. Maybe you renamed it, or moved it to another folder. If this is the case, please locate the file and include the shown code blocks manually.
* The file was found, but has changed. In this case, please study the shown code blocks and see how to integrate them in your file. 

## Modified files
Files that exist in your project and will be modified to include the feature/project.

## New files
New files generated by the feature/page added that are not available in your project.

## Unchanged files
Files that were generated as part of the new feature/page but are already part of your project. 
This can happen for example if you already added a settings storage feature and then add it another time. 
As the files are identical the files will not be copied and you do not have to take any action.
